deprecations:
  - |
    The ``glance_enable_v1_registry`` variable has been removed. When using
    the glance v1 API the registry service is required, so having a variable
    to disable it makes little sense. The service is now enabled/disabled
    for the v1 API using the ``glance_enable_v1_api`` variable.
fixes:
  - |
    When the ``glance_enable_v2_registry`` variable is set to ``True`` the
    corresponding ``data_api`` setting is now correctly set. Previously it
    was not set and therefore the API service was not correctly informed
    that the registry was operating.
